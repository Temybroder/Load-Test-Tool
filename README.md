# LoadTester

This is a Custom Node.js based Load Testing tool.
This tool fires requests in rapid successions
to a given end-point, and reports the response time
for each endpoint, as well as the average time
for all the fired requests.

This tool was orignially built with the intention
of assessing the differences between efficiency
of Horizontally-scaled multi-clustered servers
against Vertically-scaled servers.
