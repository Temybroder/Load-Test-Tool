# LoadTester

This is a Node.js based Load Testing tool.
This tool fires requests in rapid successions
to an end-point, and reports the response time
for each endpoint, as well as the average time
for all the fired requests.

This tool was orignially built with the intention
of assessing the differences between efficiency
of Horizontally-scaled multi-clustered servers as
against Vertically scaled servers.
